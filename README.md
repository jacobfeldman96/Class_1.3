## Activity 1
### RegTech
* How will RegTech change in the next 5 years? 
* Class Presenters:
* RegTech - with current companies like Facebook, Google and Tesla, Tech will be regulated internally. 
* Personal Take: Once fiat currency is replaced by crypto government currencies, then blockchain will replace any sort of Regulatory structure because regulation is already built into the code. Quantam computing could be an interesting solution for predicting fraudulent activity. But that is likely not in the realm of possibility in the next 5 years. 
* InsurTech - Headling Insurance too expensive for community - profiling and risk segmentation. Solution? Certain habitual predictors will impact your overall premium. Cars that have outfitted tech that monitor breaking, acceleration etc. will become more individualized vs being lumped together with a general demographic.   
## Git Hub Activity
* What is Git? Git is like the google docs of code which is open sourced. Used for software development. Save versioms of each change. 
* What is the repository? Online directory that saves your files publically or privately. 
* How is Git used? CLI
* What is GitHub? Online Git storage. GitBucket and GitLab are other versions of the same thing. 
* Before activity, Mia reviewed how to clone, pull and push back repositories to and from GitHub.

## Activity 2
### Who am I? What is my background?
* I am Jacob. I am a Canadian and German citizen. I just comlpeted my Master's of Arts in Vocal and Operatic Performance from the Royal Academy of Music in London. Currently, I am keenly interested in moving into the financial realm. People often do not correlate skills gained in a musical education with applicable skills in the 'outside' world. What we are taught is dedication, persistence, team-work, problem solving and ironically, humility. In order for music to happen, there needs to be consensus, direction and no one individual is more important than the project as a whole.

### What are my career goals?
* To work in the online banking or crypto industries. 
### Why did I choose FinTech as a career path?
* I chose to enroll in this course either as a full back-up, or concurrent career if my music career does not take off within the next few years. The world of FinTech is really kicking off and I hope that with the skills gained in this course, I can have the option to take part of the industry! Additionally, I've grown up in an environment where my father has always worked in start-ups so this world feels quite natural for me.

# Class Write-Up
* Today's class provided further exposure to the industries under the umbrella of FinTech with a deeper dive into RegTech. We reviewed some of the important commands in CLI and how to push and pull information from GitHub. Towards the end we worked on Markdowns and how to write visually appealing documents in VS Code. 
We also were taught how to add a ![Headshot](DSC_0526.JPG) image to VS Code and GitHub. I'm not sure if my image is going to load but I can ask the TA's before next class.
The class was wrapped up with Markdowns which included headers, a *little* bit of **Italics** and how to **_bold/italicize_** in VS Code. As well one final review of scripts, pushing and pulling to github. Finally we went over how to write a good business report. Key points of how to write a good report - problem definition = what is the problem one is solving and why it is critical?. Next step is to discuss the status quo/background and lead up to the faults with the status quo. Then add more details of the model, tech, team, client base, target market and funding. Continue to discuss why will all of these components help solve the problem and make it a successful venture? Finally discuss the solution/product and next steps.
